## Core Framework for Crafting High-Quality User Stories

### 1. Clear User-Centered Structure

All stories follow the standard format:

```
As a [specific user], I want [goal], so that [benefit].
```

**Key elements:**
- **Role** — Who is the user? (e.g., "new customer", "admin", not just "the user")
- **Goal** — What action or need do they have?
- **Why** — What value do they get from it?

### 2. Based on the INVEST Criteria

Every story should align with:

- **Independent** — Stands alone
- **Negotiable** — Not a fixed contract
- **Valuable** — Delivers user or business value
- **Estimable** — Team can size it
- **Small** — Can be completed in a sprint
- **Testable** — Measurable and verifiable

### 3. Includes Acceptance Criteria

Stories must include testable conditions defining "done."

**Example structure (Given-When-Then):**
- Given [context]
- When [action]
- Then [outcome]

**Or bullet format:**
- Must allow user to...
- Must validate that...
- Must prevent...

### 4. Focus on the Problem, Not the Solution

User stories should:
- State what the user needs
- Avoid prescribing how it should be built

This keeps them flexible and iterative.

### 5. Concise, Contextual, and Actionable

Stories should be:
- Short
- Free of jargon
- Easy to understand by design, dev, and QA
